    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 19oz can chickpeas</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons tahini</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 ice cubes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 - 2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the chickpeas and rinse them well. Add the chickpeas and baking soda to a medium pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and continue to boil for 20 minutes until the chickpeas are super tender and some chickpea skins are floating in the water.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse well with cold water to cool down the chickpeas. The chickpeas will be falling apart and many of the skins will have come off.</li>
        <li>Add the cooled chickpeas along with any chickpea skins to a blender. Add the tahini, lemon juice, ice cubes, garlic, salt, and cumin. Blend, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed, until completely smooth and creamy. If needed, you can add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour into a bowl or serving dish and enjoy plain or garnish with any optional toppings and serve with your favorite dipper. Store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 7 days. The hummus will get even more flavorful overnight in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
