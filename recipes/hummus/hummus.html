    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>a middle eastern dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="inline-block">
        <li>500g can chickpeas</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons tahini</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 ice cubes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 - 2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol class="inline-block">
        <li>drain the chickpeas and rinse them well. add the chickpeas and baking soda to a medium pot and cover with
            water. bring to a boil and continue to boil for 20 minutes until the chickpeas are super tender and some
            chickpea skins are floating in the water</li>
        <li>drain and rinse well with cold water to cool down the chickpeas. the chickpeas will be falling apart and
            many of the skins will have come off</li>
        <li>add the cooled chickpeas along with any chickpea skins to a blender. add the tahini, lemon juice, ice cubes,
            garlic, salt, and cumin. blend, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed, until completely smooth and
            creamy. if needed, you can add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until you reach your desired consistency
        </li>
        <li>pour into a bowl or serving dish and enjoy plain or garnish with any optional toppings and serve with your
            favorite dipper. store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 7 days. the hummus will get even
            more flavorful overnight in the fridge</li>
    </ol>
