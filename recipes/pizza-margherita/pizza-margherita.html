    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>tasty and light pizza choice for everybody</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="inline-block">
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>mozzarella</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol class="inline-block">
        <li>make the base: put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. make a well, pour in 200ml
            warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.
            turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. cover with a tea towel and set aside.
            You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust</li>
        <li>roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. on a
            floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. the dough
            needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets
        <li>top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas. put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in
            the oven on the top shelf. smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. scatter with cheese and
            tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the
            preheated sheet or tray. bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. serve with a little more olive oil, and basil
            leaves if using. repeat step for remaining pizza</li>
    </ol>
