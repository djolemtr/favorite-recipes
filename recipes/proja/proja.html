    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious corn-bread-like dish, perfect for a light breakfast or dinner. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 soup spoons of proja (corn) flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of white (wheat) flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (2dl) of yogurt</li>
        <li>1 cup (2dl) of mineral water</li>
        <li>250 grams of white cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>1 dl of sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 bag of baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, and most important, is to make proja for someone you love, then it has a very special taste!</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients written above in a large bowl, but do not chop the cheese too much - it is better when larger pieces remain. Grease the tray with melted margarine (or molds for bread and muffins, which I often use) and roll out the dough. Bake for 30 minutes in a preheated oven, first 10 minutes at 200 C and then another 20 minutes at 180 C.</li>
    </ol>
